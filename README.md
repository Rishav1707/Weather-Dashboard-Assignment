# Weather Dashboard: Time-bound Challenge

## Background

You are tasked with creating a weather dashboard using HTML, CSS, and ReactJS. The dashboard will display current weather information for multiple cities using a weather API.

## Basic Requirements

1. Users should be able to search for a city's weather by entering a city name.
2. Display the current weather information for multiple cities in cards.
3. Users should be able to delete a city's weather card.

## Advanced Requirements

1. Toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit for temperature display.
2. Implement pagination to display only 3 cities per page.
3. Display a basic line graph showing temperature trends for the past 24 hours for a selected city.
4. Implement a responsive design that adapts to mobile and tablet views.

## Bugs to Fix

1. The city search and addition are not functioning properly.
2. The temperature is not being displayed.
3. The delete functionality is not working.

## Tips

- Prioritize tasks and implement the basic requirements first before diving into advanced features.
- Use debugging techniques like browser developer tools or console logs effectively.
- Consider the use of third-party libraries for the line graph, but ensure you understand how it works.

## Deliverables

1. A working Weather Dashboard that meets the basic and advanced requirements. (JSfiddle link)
2. A brief write-up explaining:
   - The bugs you found and how you fixed them.
   - How you implemented the advanced features.

## Bonus

1. Add error handling for API calls.
2. Implement a loading spinner while the weather information is being fetched.
